This code can be used for developing a time table in php.
The program starts with taking entries from the user such as subject name and faculty via html forms in form of a table.
After clicking on the submit button defined inside the form, the values entered are then assigned to variables  inside php script and then printed using a table.
The structure of the table can be easily altered as per the periods and other requirements.
Also css could be added externally to make it more appealing.
